Description of target browswers:

The target browsers for my site would include the default browsers used on iOS and Android devices, such as Safari for iOS and Google Chrome for Android. These browsers are commonly found on mobile devices running the respective operating systems. When considering other devices like Windows and Mac computers, the target browsers would typically include Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. These browsers are commonly used on desktop and laptop computers.

Description of my Final Project: 

The API I chose to use was the SpaceX API (https://api.spacexdata.com/v3) and the reasoning for this was due to my interest in SpaceX and the missions they conduct. The visualizations that my project drives would be that of a pie chart displaying the successful or failed missions that SpaceX have had. The visualziation is created using the JS library of chart.js where I was able to successfully create a pie chart. The goal of the project is to provide the user with the number of successful or failed missions that SpaceX has had in a more user-friendly manner than searching through the API's confusing documentation.
